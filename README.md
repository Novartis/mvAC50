# mvAC50 - AC50 potencies from multivariate assay readouts like gene signatures

mvAC50 is an R package for the calculation of AC50s (general term for IC50s or EC50s) from multivariate assay readouts, such as gene signatures, measured at multiple concentrations. The R package provides multiple parametric and non-parametric statistical methods to quantify effects of compounds on multivariate readouts, and derive AC50s from those.
